# Contributing

## Getting started

1. Follow instructions
   to [install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
2. Follow instructions to [install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

After cloning the repo:

1. Run `poetry install` to install project and all dependencies
   (see __Dependency management__ below)
2. Run `pre-commit install` to install pre-commit hooks
   (see __Linting and Testing__ below)

(If you need to change your python version:)

```shell
poetry env use <path/to/your/python/executable>
poetry update
```

## Dependency management

This gear uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies,
develop, build and publish.

### Dependencies

Dependencies are listed in the `pyproject.toml` file.

#### Managing dependencies

* Adding: Use `poetry add [-G dev] <dep>`
* Removing: Use `poetry remove [-G dev] <dep>`
* Updating: Use `poetry update <dep>` or `poetry update` to update all deps.
  * Can also not update development dependencies with `--no-dev`
  * Update dry run: `--dry-run`

#### Using a different version of python

Poetry manages virtual environments and can create a virtual environment
with different versions of python,
however that version must be installed on the machine.

You can configure the Python version by using `poetry env use
<path/to/executable>`.
Additionally, it is important to ensure that
your Dockerfile is configured to use the same
Python version as the one specified in your Poetry environment.

#### Helpful poetry config options

See full
options [Here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#available-settings).

List current config: `poetry config --list`

* `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project <true|false|None>`:
  create virtual environment inside project directory
* `poetry config virtualenvs.path <path>`: Path to virtual environment directory.

## Linting and Testing

Local linting and testing scripts
are managed through [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/).  
Pre-commit allows running hooks which can be defined locally, or in other
repositories. Default hooks to run on each commit:

* poetry_export: Export python dependencies
  from `pyproject.toml` to `requirements.txt` with `poetry`.
* docker_build: Build the project's image from the `Dockerfile` with `docker build`.
* markdownlint: Lint markdown files for syntax, line length, style and more
  with `markdownlint`.
* yamllint: Lint YAML files for syntax, uniform indentation and style with yamllint.
* ruff: Format python code with ruff to ensures uniform whitespace and style.
* pytest: Run python tests and report code coverage with pytest.

These hooks will all run automatically on commit, but can also be run manually
or just be disabled.

More hooks can be enabled upon need. List of available
[hooks](https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/tools/etc/qa-ci#table-of-contents).

### pre-commit usage

* Run hooks manually:
  * Run on all files: `pre-commit run -a`
  * Run on certain files: `pre-commit run --files test/*`
  * Run a specific pre-commit hook (`pytest` in this case): `pre-commit run --all-files pytest`
* Update (e.g. clean and install) hooks: `pre-commit clean && pre-commit install`
* Disable all hooks: `pre-commit uninstall`
* Enable all hooks: `pre-commit install`
* Skip a hook on commit: `SKIP=<hook-name> git commit`
* Skip all hooks on commit: `git commit --no-verify`

## Adding a contribution

Every contribution should be
associated with a ticket on the GEAR JIRA board, or be a hotfix.  
You should contribute by creating
a branch titled with either `hotfix-<hotfix_name>` or `GEAR-<gear_num>-<description>`.  
For now, other branch names will be accepted,
but soon branch names will be rejected
if they don't follow this pattern.

When contributing, make a Merge Request against the main branch.

### Merge requests

The merge request should contain at least two things:

1. Your relevant change
2. Update the corresponding entry under `docs/release_notes.md`

Adding the release notes does two things:

1. It makes it easier for the
   reviewer to identify what relevant changes
   they should expect and look for in the MR, and
2. It makes it easier to create a release.

#### Populating release notes

For example, if the gear is currently on version `0.2.1`
and you are working on a bugfix under the branch GEAR-999-my-bugfix.  
When you create a merge request against `main`,
you should add a section to `docs/release_notes.md` such as the following:

```markdown
## 0.2.2

BUG:

* Fixed my-bug, see [GEAR-999](https://flywheelio.atlassian.net/browse/GEAR-999)

```

Where the rest of the file contains release notes for previous versions.
